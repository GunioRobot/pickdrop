Hi, I made this shell script so that I could
pick up files as I wander about on the command
line and then drop them in the same location.

I thought you might like it, too. In order to
install and use:

chmod 755 pick && sudo cp pick /usr/bin/
chmod 755 drop && sudo cp drop /usr/bin/

then you can cruise around and do:

pick filename
cd otherdir
pick otherfile
... etc ...

cd /home
mkdir central && cd central
drop

It's not robust at all - it stores your picks
in ~/.pick until you call drop at which time it
uses the file paths in ~/.pick to create a new
executable ~/.drop file to copy each of the
files you picked to the current working
directory.

A good enhancement would be to allow multiple
files to be picked at once:

pick file1 file2 file3

But who has time for loops in /bin/sh?!
